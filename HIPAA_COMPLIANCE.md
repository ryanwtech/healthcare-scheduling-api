## üîê Security Implementation

### **Data Encryption**

#### **At Rest**
```python
# AES-256 encryption for sensitive fields
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

class EncryptedField:
    def __init__(self, key: bytes):
        self.cipher = Fernet(key)
    
    def encrypt(self, data: str) -> str:
        return self.cipher.encrypt(data.encode()).decode()
    
    def decrypt(self, encrypted_data: str) -> str:
        return self.cipher.decrypt(encrypted_data.encode()).decode()
```

#### **In Transit**
- TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Certificate pinning for mobile applications

### **Access Control System**

#### **Role-Based Permissions**
```python
# Role definitions
ROLES = {
    "admin": ["read", "write", "delete", "manage_users"],
    "doctor": ["read", "write", "manage_appointments"],
    "patient": ["read", "write_own_data"]
}

# Permission checking
def require_permission(permission: str):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
            if permission not in ROLES.get(current_user.role, []):
                raise HTTPException(403, "Insufficient permissions")
            return func(current_user)
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

#### **API Endpoint Protection**
```python
# Protected endpoints
@router.get("/patients/{patient_id}")
@require_permission("read")
async def get_patient(patient_id: str, current_user: User):
    # Only authorized users can access patient data
    pass
```

### **Audit Logging**

#### **Comprehensive Logging**
```python
# Audit log model
class AuditLog(BaseModel):
    user_id: str
    action: str
    resource_type: str
    resource_id: str
    old_values: dict
    new_values: dict
    ip_address: str
    user_agent: str
    timestamp: datetime

# Logging decorator
def audit_log(action: str, resource_type: str):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # Log the action before execution
            log_audit_event(action, resource_type, *args, **kwargs)
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

        "threshold": 5,
        "time_window": "5 minutes",
        "action": "lock_account"
    },
    "unusual_access_pattern": {
        "threshold": "3 standard deviations",
        "action": "investigate"
    }
}
```

        # Log access attempt
        await log_access_attempt(user, request)
        
        # Check permissions
        if not await check_permissions(user, request):
            await log_unauthorized_access(user, request)
            raise HTTPException(403, "Access denied")
        
        # Process request
        response = await call_next(request)
        
        # Log successful access
